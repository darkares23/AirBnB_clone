# AirBnB CLONE web statics

## Starting
Ubuntu LTS - Operating system reqd.

## Prerequisites

- Must have git installed
- Must have repository cloned

## Description of the project

Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it‚Äôs time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to ‚Äúdesign‚Äù / ‚Äúsketch‚Äù / ‚Äúprototype‚Äù each element:

- Create simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything

 During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can‚Äôt apply any design.

Before starting, please fork or clone the repository AirBnB_clone from your partner if you were not the owner of the previous project.
